# Notes from Chris Gaucho 

Notes will be filled in here later


Perhaps I might share a link to a piece here, e.g. my SquareWave file: <https://github.com/allolib-s21/demo1-pconrad/blob/master/tutorials/allolib-s21/010_MakeSquareWave.cpp>

Here is an exceprt from the code:


Here is additive synth formulat for a square wave
```cpp
 float s1 = mAmpEnv() * ( 
        mOsc1() * a + 
        mOsc3() * (a/3.0) +
        mOsc5() * (a/5.0) +
        mOsc7() * (a/7.0)
      );
```

```python

print("This is Python Code! Look no semicolons!)

```
